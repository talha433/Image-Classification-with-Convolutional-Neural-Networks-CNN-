# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN architecture is built using TensorFlow and Keras in Python.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust image classification model capable of accurately categorizing images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built with a Convolutional Neural Network, a type of deep learning architecture well-suited for image recognition tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda (Python 3.x)
- TensorFlow

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talha433/Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-.git
   cd CNN-Image-Classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   conda create --name image-classification python=3.8
   conda activate image-classification
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   tensorflow
   matplotlib
   ```

### Dataset

The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is included in the Keras library. No additional steps are required to download the dataset.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Activate your virtual environment (if you created one):

   ```bash
   conda activate image-classification
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled-1.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the CNN model.

## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance and visualize the results using the provided Jupyter notebook.
